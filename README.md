## What is Spark DAO?

**Spark DAO** is a decentralized reserve currency protocol on the **Polygon Network**. Each SPRK token is backed by a basket of real-world assets in the Spark treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that cannot fall below the backing value. Spark DAO introduces a new branch of crypto as a whole through its unique system of staking and minting.&#x20;

## What's unique about Spark DAO?

The main benefit of Spark DAO is the unique construction of its treasury. Spark DAO holds real-world assets in its reserves such as gold(paxg), carbon credits(bct), stable coins(eurt, dai, usdc), and other synthetic assets provided by the Mirror Protocol. By holding real-world assets in the Spark treasury the protocol can eliminate the volatility of cryptocurrencies thereby creating a price-stable reserve currency system.

## How can I participate in Spark DAO?

There are two ways for getting involved with our project: Buying on dexes and Bonding. Anyone can buy or sell their SPRK tokens for a specific price determined by supply and demand on the open market. While with bonding you provide various coins like paxg, bct, and dai for discounted SPRK tokens with a fixed vesting period.

## Why use Polygon?

The Polygon Network makes it easy for small investors to participate in the project because of its low transaction fees. Polygon also has an easy-to-use ETH to MATIC bridge that will be essential for bridging Ethereum based coins like paxg and synthetic assets by the Mirror protocol, these coins will be essential for the DAOs treasury and for minting SPRK. &#x20;
