# ðŸ’° Staking

## How Staking Works

**Staking is the primary value accrual strategy of Spark DAO.** SPRK token holders can stake on Spark DAOs website to earn APR through rebases. Rebase rewards are distributed every 8 hour.  The APR rate can change every 8 hours, which results in differing rewards from one 8 hour period to the next. Profits are generated by bonding and by the treasury investments like gold, stocks, and LP tokens.

**When you stake, you are locking your SPRK and you will receive an equal amount of sSPRK.** Your **sSPRK** balance will rebase every 8 hours. As a rebasing token sSPRK can be safely transferable to any wallet without interrupting the rebase rewards.

**When you unstake, you are essentially burning your sSPRK and therefore you will receive regular SPRK.** It's important to know that regular SPKR is **NOT** a rebasing token therefore it will not receive rebase rewards.
