# ðŸ’° Staking

## How Staking Works

**Staking is the primary value accrual strategy of Spark DAO.** Stakers stake their SPRK tokens on Spark DAOs website to earn the rewards coming from rebases. Rebase rewards are distributed every 8 hours, the rewards can change depending on how much profit the treasury made in a specific timeframe. Profits are generated by bonding and by the treasury investments like gold, stocks, and LP tokens.

**When you stake, you are locking your SPRK and you will receive an equal amount of sSPRK.** Your **sSPRK** balance will rebase every 8 hours, therefore it's a rebasing token that is safely transferable to any wallet while still receiving rebase rewards.

**When you unstake, you are essentially burning your sSPRK and therefore you will receive regular SPRK.** It's important to know that regular SPKR is **NOT** a rebasing token therefore it will not receive rebase rewards.
