# üè¶ Minting

## How does minting work?

**Minting is a way to create SPRK tokens.** When individual users mint SPRK they are esential√≠ purchasing freshly minted tokes for a discount and a specific vesting period. Here is a  list of assets that will be available for minting:&#x20;

* USDC
* DAI
* EURT
* PAXG
* PAXG / DAI LP
* DAI / SPRK LP

**The mentions above can change over time!**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important:** If you want to mint SPRK with PAXG or with any synthetic asset you will need to use the Polygon ERC20 bridge, due to the ever-increasing gas fees on the Ethereum network we highly recommend sending larger amounts of assets from ETH to MATIC!
