# üè¶ Minting

## How does minting work?

**Minting is a way to create SPRK tokens.** When individual users mint SPRK they lock up the a stable coin for a given period of time. After this time period ends, the staked stable coins earn discounted SPRK tokens. Typical vesting periods are around 5 days, but the team reserves the right to change this prior to launch. The following list of assets may be used to mint SPRK at a discount:&#x20;

* USDC
* DAI
* EURT
* PAXG
* PAXG / DAI LP
* DAI / SPRK LP

**TThis list may change over time!**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important:** If you want to mint SPRK with PAXG or with any synthetic asset you will need to use the Polygon ERC20 bridge, due to the ever-increasing gas fees on the Ethereum network we highly recommend sending larger amounts of assets from ETH to MATIC!
