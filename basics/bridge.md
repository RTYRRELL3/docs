## How to bridge assets?

**Bridging is an essential part of our bonding system.** To bond any asset outside the Polygon chain you will be required to use a bridge provided by the Polygon Network. To bridge any asset go to [https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge/](https://wallet.polygon.technology/login?next=%2Fbridge%2F) and connect your Web3 wallet, then select the asset that you want to bridge then press the Transfer button.
